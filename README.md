# ratchetsequencer

a little midi sequencer that retriggers notes in the pattern so that the note is played x amount of times, but changes 
sustain time so the over all beat time doesn't change. ie 1 for retrigger is one note at 500ms, 2 is 2 notes at 250ms, 
3 is 3 notes at 166ms, 4 is 4 notes is 125ms, etc. similar to roll or studder on some drum machines, but not quite the same.
